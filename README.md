## 🔥 About ChronaX
ChronaX is a next-generation **timestamping and proof-of-existence protocol** designed to solve the major limitations of legacy timestamp systems—slow verification, single-chain dependency, high cost, and weak historical auditability.

ChronaX introduces a **multi-chain, tamper-proof, and cost-efficient** timestamp architecture that ensures long-term data integrity and universal verifiability.

---

## 🎯 Core Mission
- Deliver **unmanipulable timestamps** without relying on a single blockchain.  
- Provide instant and permanent **proof-of-existence** for any file, message, or digital content.  
- Eliminate the weaknesses of traditional timestamp systems.  
- Become the global **Internet Timestamp Layer** for public users, developers, institutions, and Web2/Web3 applications.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Multi-Chain Anchoring**  
  ChronaX anchors timestamps to several blockchains for redundancy and trust.

- **Zero-Cost Submission**  
  Users can submit data proofs without paying direct gas fees.

- **Privacy-Friendly Hash Proofs**  
  Only hashed data is stored—your documents remain private.

- **Time Consistency Validator**  
  Detects manipulation attempts and enforces absolute time integrity.

- **Developer-First APIs**  
  Simple and powerful API endpoints for seamless integration.
